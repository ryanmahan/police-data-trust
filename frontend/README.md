This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First install dependencies
`npm i` || `yarn install`

if you run into an error such as

```
/police-data-trust/frontend/node_modules/husky/lib/index.js:20
        throw new Error(`.git can't be found (see ${url})`);
        ^

Error: .git can't be found
```

you can copy the .git/ directory in the root of the project and move it to the frontend/ and try the install again and it should succeed. try the install again and remember do not commit this .git/ you may want to delete it afterwards until figured out alernative.

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
